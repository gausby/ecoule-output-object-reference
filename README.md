==================================
An [Écoule][ecoule-core] transform output put the result data from a given Écoule transformer output into an object literal for later use in a JavaScript runtime.

[ecoule-core]: https://github.com/gausby/ecoule


## Usage
Attach it as an output of an Écoule data transformer. It takes one configuration option:

  * `result` Put a reference to an object here. When the output is executed the data will reside in the passed in reference.

Options should get passed in as an Object.


## Development
After cloning the project you will have to run `npm install` in the project root. This will install the various grunt plugins and other dependencies.


### QA tools
The QA tools rely on the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) task runner. To run any of these tools, you will need the grunt-cli installed globally on your system. This is easily done by typing the following in a terminal.

    $ npm install grunt-cli -g

The unit tests will need the [Buster](http://busterjs.org/) unit test framework.

    $ npm install -g buster

These two commands will install the buster and grunt commands on your system. These can be removed by typing `npm uninstall buster -g` and `npm uninstall grunt-cli -g`.


### Unit Tests
If you haven't all ready install the Grunt CLI tools and have a look at the grunt configuration file in the root of the project.

When developing you want to run the script watcher. Navigate to the project root and type the following in your terminal.

    $ grunt watch:scripts

This will run the jshint and tests each time a file has been modified.
